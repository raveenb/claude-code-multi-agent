# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository named "claude-code-multi-agent" that appears to be in its initial stages. The repository currently contains only basic files (LICENSE, README.md) and no source code or build configuration.

## Current State

- **No build system**: No package.json, build scripts, or dependency management files found
- **No source code**: No .js, .ts, .py, or other source files present
- **No test framework**: No testing infrastructure detected
- **No development tools**: No linting, formatting, or other development tool configurations

## Development Commands

Since this is a new repository without a build system, there are currently no specific commands to run. Future development will likely require:

1. Setting up a package manager (npm, yarn, pip, etc.)
2. Adding build and test scripts
3. Implementing the multi-agent functionality referenced in the project name

## Architecture

The repository structure is minimal and will need to be established based on the intended multi-agent system design.
