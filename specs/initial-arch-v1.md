# Multi-Agent Claude Code Orchestration System - Initial Architecture v1

## Overview

This system coordinates multiple Claude Code instances to work collaboratively on complex software projects. It features an architect instance that plans and coordinates work, and specialized service instances that handle specific domains like frontend, backend, database, and AI components.

## Core Components

### 1. Orchestrator (`orchestrator.py`)
- **Primary Process**: Manages the entire multi-agent system
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Spawns and manages Claude Code instances
  - Handles inter-instance communication via shared filesystem
  - Manages task queue and state coordination
  - Monitors instance health and handles failures

### 2. Architect Instance
- **Role**: Lead developer and system architect
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Analyze high-level requirements and devise implementation plans
  - Break down complex tasks into service-specific subtasks
  - Coordinate cross-service dependencies and sequencing
  - Resolve conflicts when multiple services modify shared resources
  - Review and approve major architectural decisions
- **Access**: Hybrid approach - read access to all directories for planning, delegates execution to services

### 3. Service Instances
- **Role**: Domain-specific developers
- **Types**: Frontend, Backend, Database, AI, Testing, DevOps, etc.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Execute tasks within their domain expertise
  - Coordinate with other services through architect mediation
  - Update task status and communicate completion
  - Handle domain-specific code changes and maintenance

## Communication Architecture

### Shared Filesystem Approach
```
.multi-agent/
├── tasks.json           # Global task queue
├── state.json          # System state tracking
├── messages/           # Inter-service communication
│   ├── architect/      # Messages for architect
│   ├── frontend/       # Messages for frontend service
│   ├── backend/        # Messages for backend service
│   └── ...
└── logs/              # Instance activity logs
```

### Message Flow
1. Orchestrator receives user input and creates initial task
2. Architect instance analyzes and breaks down into subtasks
3. Tasks are queued with dependencies in `tasks.json`
4. Service instances poll for assigned tasks
5. Services update task status and communicate via message files
6. Architect monitors progress and handles coordination

## Configuration System

### Service Definition (`multi-agent.yaml`)
```yaml
services:
  architect:
    persona: "Lead architect focused on system design and coordination"
    access_level: "global_read"
    tools_allowed: ["all"]
    directories: ["/"]
    
  frontend:
    persona: "Frontend developer focused on UI/UX and performance"
    programming_languages: ["TypeScript", "JavaScript", "CSS"]
    frameworks: ["React", "Next.js", "Tailwind"]
    directories: ["src/frontend", "public", "styles"]
    tools_allowed: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "WebFetch"]
    tools_restricted: ["git commit", "gh pr create"]
    mcp_servers: ["frontend-tools", "design-system"]
    
  backend:
    persona: "Backend developer focused on APIs and data processing"
    programming_languages: ["Python", "JavaScript", "SQL"]
    frameworks: ["FastAPI", "Express", "SQLAlchemy"]
    directories: ["src/backend", "api", "database"]
    tools_allowed: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash"]
    tools_restricted: ["WebFetch", "git commit"]
    mcp_servers: ["database-tools", "api-docs"]
    
  database:
    persona: "Database specialist focused on schema and migrations"
    programming_languages: ["SQL", "Python"]
    frameworks: ["SQLAlchemy", "Alembic"]
    directories: ["database", "migrations"]
    tools_allowed: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash"]
    mcp_servers: ["database-migration"]
```

## Task Coordination

### Task Queue System (MVP)
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task_001",
      "title": "Add user authentication",
      "status": "pending",
      "assigned_to": "backend",
      "created_by": "architect",
      "dependencies": [],
      "priority": "high",
      "description": "Implement JWT-based authentication system"
    }
  ]
}
```

### State Management
```json
{
  "active_instances": {
    "architect": {"status": "active", "current_task": "task_planning"},
    "frontend": {"status": "active", "current_task": "task_002"},
    "backend": {"status": "busy", "current_task": "task_001"}
  },
  "completed_tasks": ["task_000"],
  "failed_tasks": []
}
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Failure Response Strategy
1. **Task Failure**: 3 automatic retries with exponential backoff
2. **Instance Failure**: Fallback to architect for task reassignment
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Architect mediates shared resource conflicts
4. **Critical Failures**: Manual intervention required, system pauses

### Health Monitoring
- Heartbeat mechanism for instance health checks
- Task timeout detection (configurable per service)
- Resource conflict detection and resolution

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Orchestrator process with instance management
- [ ] Shared filesystem communication layer
- [ ] Basic task queue system
- [ ] Service configuration loading

### Phase 2: Basic Multi-Agent Coordination
- [ ] Architect instance with task breakdown capabilities
- [ ] Simple service instances (frontend, backend)
- [ ] Message routing and status updates
- [ ] Basic error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Complex dependency management
- [ ] Conflict resolution mechanisms
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Technical Considerations

### Claude API Integration
- Direct API calls rather than CLI wrapper
- Instance context management for conversation continuity
- Token usage optimization across instances

### File System Permissions
- Directory-level access controls per service
- Read-only vs read-write permissions
- Shared resource protection mechanisms

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling: Multiple instances per service type
- Vertical scaling: Resource allocation per instance
- Load balancing for high-throughput scenarios

## Example Workflow

### User Request: "Add user profile management feature"

1. **Orchestrator** receives request, creates initial task
2. **Architect** analyzes requirements:
   - Database schema changes needed
   - Frontend profile UI components
   - Backend API endpoints
   - Authentication integration
3. **Task Breakdown**:
   - `database`: Create user_profiles table and migration
   - `backend`: Implement profile CRUD API endpoints
   - `frontend`: Build profile management UI
   - `testing`: Create integration tests
4. **Execution Sequence**:
   - Database migration runs first
   - Backend API development begins
   - Frontend development starts after API contracts defined
   - Testing validates complete feature
5. **Coordination**: Architect monitors progress, handles any conflicts or dependencies

## Security Considerations

- Tool restrictions per service to prevent unauthorized actions
- Directory access controls to maintain separation of concerns
- Audit logging for all inter-service communications
- Safe handling of secrets and credentials

## Future Enhancements

- DAG-based task dependency management
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Dynamic service discovery and scaling
- Advanced conflict resolution algorithms
- Performance metrics and optimization
- Plugin architecture for custom service types
